/**
 * Create a program that prompts the user to enter the model number of an inventory item. Then, query the inventory2 table
 * (created by running CreateInventory2Table.java) and print the name of the item, the price, and the quantity. If the model number
 * does not match any existing records, print a message stating the item could not be found.
 *
 * The program only needs to prompt once. It does not need to perpetually ask for model numbers.
 *
 * This program is only concerned with selecting records, not updating, inserting, or deleting records.
 * Review InsertInventoryRecords2.java for an example of concatenating variables as part of a SQL query/statement.
 *
 *
 * SAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT 1
 * Enter the model number: 10002
 *
 * Item Name: Screwdriver
 * Quantity: 15
 * Price: $8.00
 *
 *
 * SAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT 2
 * Enter the model number: 123YZ
 *
 * No matching items found.
