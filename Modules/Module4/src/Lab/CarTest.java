/**
 * Unit Tests for the Car Class.
 * Be sure to study the Car class's methods first. It is a slightly modified version of the one from Module 2.
 *
 * Create at least three unit tests (three test methods) that will test the Car class.
 * You could create three unit tests (three test methods) that all test the Car's speed, or
 * you could create unit tests with one testing speed, another the fuel level, and the third for testing the odometer.
 *
 * Feel free to test whatever you like with Car objects, just be sure to have at least three unit tests (three test methods).
 * I recommend taking a look at the Bicycle Test program in the SampleCode folder.
 *
 * Be sure to include the @Test annotation if you create any additional test methods.
