/**
 * This program will simultaneously read three files.
 *
 * In the main method, create three File objects- one for each of the files contained in this folder
 * (numbers1.txt, numbers2.txt, numbers3.txt)
 * Windows users: "src\\Lab\\numbers1.txt"
 * Mac/Linux users: "src/Lab/numbers1.txt" or use the full path
 *
 * Instantiate three FileReaderThread objects. When instantiating these objects, pass one of the File objects to each.
 * (You'll need to first complete the provided FileReaderThread class)
 *
 * Call the start method on all three of the FileReaderThread objects. Allow each thread to complete.
 * (The thread should print the total when it has finished summing the numbers in its file)
 *
 * Be sure to use exception handling (try/catch) structures as needed.
