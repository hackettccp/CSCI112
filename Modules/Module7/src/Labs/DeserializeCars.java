 * Included in this Lab folder is a binary file, Cars.dat, that contains THREE serialized Car objects.
 * The class for the Car object is provided, but requires no changes. It only has a speed field.
 *
 * Prior to being serialized, all three Car objects were accelerated to different speeds.
 *
 * For this lab, deserialize the three Car objects and print each of their speeds (use each Car object's getSpeed method)
