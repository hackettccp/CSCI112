/**
 * Car Object.
 * 
 * Create four private fields: make (String), model (String), year (int), and speed (int).
 * Do not give the fields default/starting values.
 * 
 * Create a constructor that accepts three arguments (for the make, model, and year fields).
 * The constructor should set the speed field to 0.
 * 
 * Create accessors for each of the four fields.
 * 
 * Create mutators for only the make, model, and year fields.
 * 
 * Create a public void method called accelerate that adds 5 to the speed field.
 * 
 * Create a public void method called brake that subtracts 5 from the speed field.
 * Ensure the car's speed does not go below zero.
 *
 * Create a public method called getDistance that returns a double. The function should accept
 * an argument (int) called time. When called the method will calculate and return the distance
 * the car will travel at its current speed.
 * D = S * T
 *
 * Create a public method called getTime that returns a double. The function should accept
 * an argument (int) called distance. When called the method will calculate and return the time
 * it will take the car to travel that distance at its current speed.
 * T = D / S
